## Welcome to No Brakes!

This is my first game!

I started creating this game for a class project.
However, it developed into a passion for game making and I plan to make the full game.

The idea for this game is all origional and was imagined by my younger self back in 2021.

**The premise is simple, slide, jump, shoot. Get a high score and then try and beat it.**

I hope you enjoy and feel free to give feedback or offer suggestions for the game!
